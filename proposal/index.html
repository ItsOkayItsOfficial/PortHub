  <h3 class="margin">WHAT?</h3>
  <p>As a development team we didn't want to create a vanity project, whether something extremely useful for anyone struggling to find a 
    foothold in the development world. After brainstorming in a coffee shop for hours, we came upon a question. "How can we help aspiring dev's create an online presence?"
  Thus, the birth of PortHub. A "one-stop shop" for developers to build resume's and portfolios and launch them online. Making it easy for any new developer to find a portfolio
template and use it completely how they see fit. Once finished with the portfolio, the application guides our user into publishing their content to their own Github repository.
Ensuring that the portfolio they generate is comepletely their own. From beginning to end, Porthub is designed for the user to leave their mark on the worls. </p>

<!-- Building a full stack application utilizing React.JS. This project is the culkmination of what we have learned in class. Using ALL the 
    skills we have learned thus far. By far the BIGGEST hurdle thus far was coming up with an approachable, usable idea. Bringing talent 
    together is easy but poiting talent in the same direction is hard.
